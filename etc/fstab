#A Zincum fstab is a file that adds directories accessible to all users
#lets say you have a folder called share in folder /dev
#then you would write something like below

#NDX is just an index always should be DIR
#Sname is the share dir name (any name)
#Pusr is if you want to not give a specific user access to the share (usr1,usr2,usr3,...)
#perm is permissions (full or view) (full is read/write , view is readOnly)

#NDX Sname Pusr perm

#DIR share none full
